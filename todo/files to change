scenario.cpp: handle multiple robots
    -> edit the scenario.cpp Init
    -> Make changes to StartPosition.cpp to allow the class to handle vectors
    -> Obstacles need to be coded in as well
    -> add start positions and azimuth


Robot.cpp: edit the Init, by running it threaded
    ->

FileViewerLog.cpp: to handle recording multiple robots (To be done later)
    -> modify the class to accept the new created vectors. E.g. FileViewer.cpp to read in a vector of BodyParts 
        of the vector of Robots

ChasingScenario.cpp
    -> need to change simulation step

RacingScenario.cpp
    -> need to add analysis for multiple robots

RobogenConfig.h (Potential Change)
    ->

Viewer.cpp  
    ++ Check if we need to make changes to renderModels (global variable?) Ref:1

RobogenCollision.cpp 
    -> alter to enable multiple robots

WebGLLogger.cpp
    -> change from single robot
